    Spatie Permissions
        Relations
        1. model has permissions (direct permission)
        2. model has roles
        3. role has permissions (permission via role)

        User
        user may have permissions directly called direct permissions or has permissions via roles or both (exclude duplicates)
        e.g. user has admin role,admin can edit posts or a user may not have admin role but can edit posts because hase direct permission

        https://spatie.be/docs/laravel-permission/v5/best-practices/roles-vs-permissions

        for simplicity we just use roles for users not permissions
        e.g. users have roles which enable users to do specific actions
