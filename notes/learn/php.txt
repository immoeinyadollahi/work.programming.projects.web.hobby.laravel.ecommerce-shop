we have only 3 ways to check if variable (variables defined by $,array properties,object properties) exists or not without throwing error
1. null coalescing operator
2. isset
3. empty

using anything else such as functions throw error which say undefined variable 






empty
return false if variable exists and is not a falsy value
return true if variable doesn't exist or is a falsy value

its like a combination of isset and boolean
